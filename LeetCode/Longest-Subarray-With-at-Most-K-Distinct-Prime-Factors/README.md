# Longest Subarray With at Most K Distinct Prime Factors

Can you solve this real interview question? Longest Subarray With at Most K Distinct Prime Factors - You are given an integer array nums consisting of positive integers and an integer k.

The prime factor set of a subarray is the union of the distinct prime factors of all its elements.

Return the length of the longest subarray whose prime factor set contains at most k distinct prime factors. If no such subarray exists, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [7,6,10,12,11], k = 3

Output: 3

Explanation:

Consider the subarray [6, 10, 12]:

 * The distinct prime factors of 6 are {2, 3}.
 * The distinct prime factors of 10 are {2, 5}.
 * The distinct prime factors of 12 are {2, 3}.
 * The union of these sets is {2, 3, 5}, which contains 3 distinct prime factors.

No longer subarray satisfies the condition. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,6,9,18], k = 4

Output: 4

Explanation:

Consider the entire array [4, 6, 9, 18]:

 * The distinct prime factors of 4 are {2}.
 * The distinct prime factors of 6 are {2, 3}.
 * The distinct prime factors of 9 are {3}.
 * The distinct prime factors of 18 are {2, 3}.
 * The union of these sets is {2, 3}, which contains 2 distinct prime factors.

Since 2 <= 4, the entire array is valid. Therefore, the answer is 4.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [6,10,15], k = 2

Output: 1

Explanation:

Every subarray of length at least 2 has prime factor set {2, 3, 5}, which contains 3 distinct prime factors.

Since 3 > 2, only subarrays of length 1 are valid. Therefore, the answer is 1.
